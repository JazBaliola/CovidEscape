### Why is it called Covid Escape? 🤔

It's called Covid Escape because on everygame that I have played it's always the user character is the "goodguy". That's why I made my game to be different so that I made the user character the enemy escaping from the vaccine and spreading all over the world. And when the user character dies it shows the screen saying thanks to healthcare heroes because the covid did not escape/spread because of them. So basically I created this game to **Thank Healthcare Workers!** 🧡
